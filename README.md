# Customer-Churn-Predection
Capita works with a number of Telco companies and we are aware that customer churn is often a 
problem in the Telco sector. We are therefore looking to create a solution that will predict churn and help 
define prevention measures for these companies.
To better understand what is involved in creating such a solution and how to implement it in a client 
organisation, we ask you to do some research and create a predictive model using one of two datasets 
provided. 
The two datasets are sample data of two Telco companies (A and B). They contain attributes of the 
customers in terms of their usage, services and some demographic data. They also contain a variable -
‘churn’, indicating whether a customer has discontinued with the service or not. Each row in the data 
represents one customer.
